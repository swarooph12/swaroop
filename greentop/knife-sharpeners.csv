        The sharpening wheels on your <b>Smith's Edge Pro Electric/Manual Knife Sharpener</b> are made from bonded synthetics. The synthetics used are selected for their ability to guarantee longer wheel life, uniform cutting, and minimum heat build up, so that de-tempering of your blade does not occur.<br><br>Smith's wheels are manufactured according to strict tolerances in order to ensure the same high quality on each and every wheel made.<br><br>The crossed ceramic rods put the final finished edge on your blade. Crossed ceramic rods create a pre-set sharpening angle that lightly hones both sides of your blade at the same time; thus, putting a polished, razor-sharp edge on your knife. Also, use the crossed ceramic rods for a quick touch-up of already sharp knives. Just a few, quick pulls through the sharpening slot is all it takes. Smith's recommends always using the ceramic rods for final edge honing after you sharpen using the synthetic wheels. Again, just a few pulls through the sharpening slot is all it takes.<b>Features:</b><ul><li><b>Model:</b> 50005</li><li>Pre-set Sharpening Angles</li><li>Sharpens Both Sides of the Blade</li><li>Ceramic Rods for Final Edge Honing</li><li>Soft-Grip Rubber Handle</li><li>Non-Slip Rubber Feet</li></ul>
