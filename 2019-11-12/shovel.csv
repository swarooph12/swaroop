Cracks on sidewalks are not a problem and the rounded edge will not damage golf course greens, artificial turf or cover tarps. The shovel is currently being used by professional stadiums and major universities. With a flip of the wrist you can change the adjustable angle of the blade from right to left (10 degree or 5 degree angle). You can also customize the handle grips to fit your height and weight. Traditional shovels make you lift and twist whereas the Perfect Shovel uses your body weight and forearms to push.
