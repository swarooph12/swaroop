206058495,XBU02Z,120 MPH 473 CFM 18-Volt X2 (36-Volt) LXT Lithium-Ion Cordless Brushless Leaf Blower (Tool-Only),"Landscapers and contractors are demanding more cordless alternatives to corded and gas-powered outdoor power equipment. Makita is meeting demand with an expanding line of cordless OPE, including the 18-Volt X2 LXT Lithium-Ion (36-Volt) Brushless Blower (model XBU02Z, tool only). With zero emissions, lower noise and considerably less maintenance, the 18-Volt X2 (36-Volt) Cordless Blower is a welcome solution for clean-up applications. Its powered by two 18-Volt LXT batteries for 36-Volt power and run time, but without leaving the strongly-preferred 18-Volt battery platform. And with the efficient Makita BL brushless motor, the blower delivers longer run time, more power and speed and longer tool life. Makita's efficient BL brushless motor is electronically controlled to optimize battery energy use for up to 50% longer run time per battery charge than similar non-brushless tools.

206058495,XBU02Z,120 MPH 473 CFM 18-Volt X2 (36-Volt) LXT Lithium-Ion Cordless Brushless Leaf Blower (Tool-Only),"Landscapers and contractors are demanding more cordless alternatives to corded and gas-powered outdoor power equipment. Makita is meeting demand with an expanding line of cordless OPE, including the 18-Volt X2 LXT Lithium-Ion (36-Volt) Brushless Blower (model XBU02Z, tool only). With zero emissions, lower noise and considerably less maintenance, the 18-Volt X2 (36-Volt) Cordless Blower is a welcome solution for clean-up applications. Its powered by two 18-Volt LXT batteries for 36-Volt power and run time, but without leaving the strongly-preferred 18-Volt battery platform. And with the efficient Makita BL brushless motor, the blower delivers longer run time, more power and speed and longer tool life. Makita's efficient BL brushless motor is electronically controlled to optimize battery energy use for up to 50% longer run time per battery charge than similar non-brushless tools.

206058495,XBU02Z,120 MPH 473 CFM 18-Volt X2 (36-Volt) LXT Lithium-Ion Cordless Brushless Leaf Blower (Tool-Only),"Landscapers and contractors are demanding more cordless alternatives to corded and gas-powered outdoor power equipment. Makita is meeting demand with an expanding line of cordless OPE, including the 18-Volt X2 LXT Lithium-Ion (36-Volt) Brushless Blower (model XBU02Z, tool only). With zero emissions, lower noise and considerably less maintenance, the 18-Volt X2 (36-Volt) Cordless Blower is a welcome solution for clean-up applications. Its powered by two 18-Volt LXT batteries for 36-Volt power and run time, but without leaving the strongly-preferred 18-Volt battery platform. And with the efficient Makita BL brushless motor, the blower delivers longer run time, more power and speed and longer tool life. Makita's efficient BL brushless motor is electronically controlled to optimize battery energy use for up to 50% longer run time per battery charge than similar non-brushless tools.
