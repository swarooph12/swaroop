206300133,WX429L,4 Amp 4-1/2 in. Corded WorxSaw,"The WX429L WorxSaw can essentially replace a DIYer's need for a full-size 7-1/4 in. circular saw. This saw was born to cut wood, especially 2 in. nominal lumber materials. This saw weighs only 4.5 lbs., so it is easy to transport and maneuver. The grip and safety trigger provides great comfort, balance and control. The 4-1/2 in. blade cuts 2X4s in a single pass and is about 50% lighter than conventional 7-1/4 in. circular saws. Plus, the lightweight saw's left-sided blade design provides remarkable cut-line visibility. The saw's 4-1/2 in. blade has a kerf that is less than half the Thickness: of larger 7-1/4 in. circular saw blades. Since this smaller, thinner blade takes much less effort and motor strain to cut through the material, the 4 Amp - 3500 RPM saw can match the performance of full-size circular saws. The saw's maximum cutting depth at 90° is 1-11/16 in. and the bevel capacity at 45° is 1-1/8 in. The saw also features a dust extraction port and a 1-1/4 in. vacuum adapter for dust collection and a clean work environment.","Bullet04 : Left-sided blade design for great cut-line visibility,Bullet02 : Grip with integrated safety trigger for comfort, balance, and control,Bullet23 : <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/c/electronics_recycling_programs style=color:#F96302; target=_blank>Click here for more information on Electronic Recycling Programs</a>,Bullet05 : Bevel adjustment for 0°-45°bevel cutting capabilities,Bullet22 : <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_3c.jpg""></center><br /> <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_4_Edit.jpg""></center><br />,Bullet01 : Small, compact size for excellent maneuverability and portability,Bullet21 : <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_3a.jpg""></center><br /> <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_3b.jpg""></center><br />,Bullet20 : <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_1_Edit.jpg""></center><br /> <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_2.jpg""></center><br />,Bullet03 : Exceptional depth-of-cut for cutting 2 in. stock lumber,Bullet06 : Dust port for dust vac hookup and a clean work environment,MFG Brand Name : Worx",49.99 / 49.99,"Product Highlight 3 : Safety trigger provides great control and an easy grip,Product Highlight 1 : Perfect for cutting 2 in. nominal wood,Product Highlight 2 : Lightweight design makes it easy to maneuver and transport",4.6253,"https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/18748f96-f640-438e-8c00-49ac6d0149bd/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-64_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/88eb17b1-7c7a-4203-8b9a-50484599ede9/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-e1_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/b9ef713b-d979-4827-bddd-6929ae6a506f/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-40_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/cb96d85e-8983-4e99-b2ee-1b804c48b681/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-a0_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/e12dec26-dd7c-4740-ae2b-9e88bfffa1c8/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-1d_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/fa02a33f-461b-49aa-93f0-ad3603117a97/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-66_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/5974f786-e4df-4309-bba2-cbc568dd2951/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-77_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/27c51bed-369a-43af-af4d-5cb6e70b377e/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-c3_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/d18ac8b9-29c9-4059-b087-ecb0a376f75c/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-4f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/1f3ca937-d62c-4088-aaa1-91ff434aa1ad/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-1f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/1f3ca937-d62c-4088-aaa1-91ff434aa1ad/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-44_1000.jpg","Blade Location : Left,Included Accessories : Blades,Returnable : 90-Day,Power Tool Features : Depth Adjustment,Electric Brake,Keyed Blade Change,Spindle Lock,Saw Drive Type : Sidewinder,Amperage (amps) : 4,Bevel Capacity : 45,Cordless/ Corded : Corded,Blade Diameter (in.) : 4-1/2,Tools Product Type : Power Tool,Depth Adjustment : No,Color Family : Black,Construction Material : Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS),Cord Length (ft.) : 5,Condition : New,Corded Tool Type : Circular Saw,Maximum Cut Depth @ 45 Deg. : 1.2,Cuts Through : Aluminum,PVC,Plastic,Wood,Maximum Speed (rpm) : 3500,Product Weight (lb.) : 4.25,Maximum Cut Depth @ 90 Deg. : 1.8,Product Depth (in.) : 18.25,Product Height (in.) : 4.375,Product Width (in.) : 4.875,Blade Diameter : 4-1/2,Manufacturer Warranty : 3 years limited,Certifications and Listings : ETL Classified","Use and Care Manual : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/56/56676216-e260-48bb-b75f-40a09b7fa48f.pdf,Replacement Part List : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/f5/f5780cb8-9b00-4350-8e64-ac208a45cff9.pdf,Warranty : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/0e/0e28a64d-a7a5-47c2-8643-c0aa91e8f4a0.pdf"

307288231,XSH06PT1,18-Volt X2 LXT Lithium-Ion (36-Volt) Brushless Cordless 7-1/4 in. Circular Saw Kit with 4 Batteries (5.0Ah),"Makita, a pioneer in brushless motor technology and battery innovation, combines both in the 18-Volt X2 LXT (36-Volt) Lithium-Ion Brushless 7-1/4 Circular Saw Kit (XSH06PT1). It's powered by two 18-Volt LXT Lithium-Ion batteries for maximum performance, and has an electronically-controlled BL Brushless motor that matches torque and RPM to the application. Makita 18-Volt X2 means freedom from the cord, even for demanding applications like cutting sheet and dimensional lumber that traditionally called for a corded saw. Best of all, users can remain in one battery platform, using the same fast-charging 18-Volt batteries with the XSH06PT1 as they use across the expansive Makita 18-Volt LXT cordless tool system. The XSH06PT1 has a long list of features for efficient cutting without the cord. The electronically-controlled brushless motor delivers a full 6,000 RPM for efficient cutting, with Automatic Speed Change technology to adjust the cutting speed and torque under load for optimum performance. In internal testing, the XSH06PT1 made up to 600 cross-cuts per charge in 2x4 SPF lumber using two fully-charged 5.0Ah batteries. Added features include a large 2-11/16 cutting capacity at 90°, and an electric brake for maximum productivity. The saw has a die-cast magnesium base and blade guard with die-cast aluminum blade cover and motor housing, which combines durability with less weight (only 10.4 lbs. with batteries, sold separately).","Bullet22 : <br /><br /><center><a href=""https://www.homedepot.com/s/Makita%2520LXT?NCNI-5."" target=""_blank""><br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/MAKITA USA INC/LXT Updated Inline Content_4.11.2019.jpg""></center><br /></a></center><br />,Bullet12 : Extreme Protection Technology (XPT) is engineered for improved dust and water resistance for operation in harsh conditions,Bullet01 : Powered by 2 LXT batteries;

It's powered by two 18-Volt LXT Lithium-Ion batteries for maximum performance, and has an electronically-controlled BL Brushless motor that matches torque and RPM to the application. Makita 18-Volt X2 means freedom from the cord, even for demanding applications like cutting sheet and dimensional lumber that traditionally called for a corded saw. Best of all, users can remain in 1 battery platform, using the same fast-charging 18-Volt batteries with the XSH06PT as they use across the expansive Makita 18-Volt LXT cordless tool system. The XSH06PT has a long list of features for efficient cutting without the cord. The electronically-controlled brushless motor delivers a full 6,000 RPM for efficient cutting, with Automatic Speed Change technology to adjust the cutting speed and torque under load for optimum performance. In internal testing, the XSH06PT made up to 600 cross-cuts per charge in 2x4 SPF lumber using 2 fully-charged 5.0Ah batteries.

310735605,CT1065,10 Amp 6.5 in. Plunge Cut Sidewinder Circular Track Saw,"Remember when your saw stayed on the right track. Keep your cuts on the straight and narrow with the WEN 10 Amp Sidewinder Plunge Cut Track Saw. The WEN Track Saw provides users the same results as a table or panel saw in a compact and portable package. Simply lay the track (not included model CT9980) along the desired surface for a clean and smooth cut. The WEN Track Saw is the perfect companion for ripping plywood, trimming doors, building furniture and any other application needing long, precise cuts. Our powerful 10 Amp motor rotates the 6-1/2 in. blade up to 5500 times per minute, letting you power through even the hardest of woods. Bevel the saw 45° to the left to create angled cuts in boards up to 1-5/8 in. thick. Set the depth gauge anywhere from 0 to 2-1/3 in. to control how deep the saw plunges. The 12 in. x 6-5/8 in. base features precision grooves that let the saw glide smoothly along the track. However, the saw can also exist on its own as a plunge saw, relying on its flat base for maximum stability and precision. Easily switch between 3 different blade settings: 1 for scoring cuts that go 1/8 in. D, 1 for full plunge cuts and 1 to simplify blade changes. The back-mounted dust port allows for attachment to your favorite dust collection system to control sawdust and limit cleanup. Simply attach your dust collection device of choice and start sawing.

305967919,WX523L,Worxsaw 20-Volt 3-3/8 in. Compact Circular Saw,"The WX523L 20-Volt WORXSAW is an entry point cordless saw for the beginner DIY'er or a second saw for the small projects. This saw was born to cut wood, especially 1 in. nominal lumber materials. This saw weighs only 4-1/2 lbs., so it is easy to transport and maneuver. The grip and safety trigger provide great comfort, balance and control. The 3-3/8 in. blade cuts all 1X material and is the lightest circular saw. Plus, the lightweight saw's left-sided blade design provides remarkable cut-line visibility. The saw's 3-3/8 in. blade has a kerf that is less than half the thickness of larger 7-1/4 in. circular saw blades.

302781709,KMA2685,24 in. Rip-Cut Aluminum Circular Saw Guide,"The Kreg rip-cut turns your circular saw into a precision edge-guided cutting tool that makes straight, accurate, repeatable cuts in plywood, MDF and other large sheets. With the rip-cut, you can cut with the confidence you want and the precision you need. The rip-cut easily makes straight, accurate, repeatable cuts without measuring, marking or having to keep the saw on the cut line. The rip-cut does this with a long edge guide that follows the straight edge of the sheet you are cutting. So, all you have to do is lock the saw in at the measurement you want up to 24 in. using the built-in measuring scale and then make your cut. With a built-in measuring scale, you don't have to measure and mark each cut, either. Just lock the saw sled at your desired cut width and you're all set, whether you need to cut 1-piece or make multiple pieces of the exact same size. Plus, the rip-cut makes it easier to cut down large sheets by yourself. The rip-cut is very easy to use. Simply mount your saw to the universal sled it accepts most left-blade or right-blade saw-sand then slide the sled onto the aluminum rail. After a simple 1-time calibration, you can lock in your cut width (up to 24 in.) using the measuring scale and precision cursor. Then, just hold the edge guide against the edge of your sheet as you guide the saw. You will get straight, accurate, repeatable cuts easily every time.","Bullet05 : Eliminate need for marking, measuring and layout lines,Bullet06 : Take your saw to the material instead of having to take your material to the saw,Bullet04 : Use the oversize edge guide for precise control throughout the cut,MFG Brand Name : Kreg,Bullet03 : Cut multiple pieces to the same size with just 1-setup,Bullet07 : Universal sled accepts most circular saw left or right blade,Bullet02 : Make rip cuts and crosscuts up to 24 in.

302781729,KMA2700,48 in. Accu-Cut Aluminum Circular Saw Track,"Start projects right by making straight, accurate, splinter-free cuts with your circular saw and the accu-cut circular saw guide track system. It rips, crosscuts and makes angled cuts up to 48 in. long in plywood, MDF and other large panels with super-simple setup, precise accuracy and amazing control. The accu-cut guides your circular saw along an aluminum track that keeps the saw moving in a straight line easily. The accu-cut design makes it simple to set up by just aligning the track with your cut line. No clamps are required to hold the track in place thanks to dual guide strips. They feature an anti-slip coating to prevent slipping and an anti-chip feature to prevent splintered cuts. Plus, the track makes it easy to make straight cuts on sheets that don't have a straight, flat edge. Circular saws don't have effective guides that keep them moving straight along a cut line. Plus, it can be difficult to see the blades cutting path. Together, these things make it challenging to keep a saw on your desired cut. Circular saws also often cause splintering of face veneers. The accu-cut solves these problems. The accu-cut is portable, too, so you can take your saw to the work-piece and cut with precision, rather than having to handle heavy sheets on a table saw. The accu-cut is easy and intuitive for a novice to use, but robust enough for professionals.","Bullet08 : Take your saw to the material instead of having to take your material to the saw,Bullet04 : Hold track in place without clamps thanks to anti-slip guide strips,Bullet02 : Rip, crosscut and make angled cuts up to 48 in.

206300133,WX429L,4 Amp 4-1/2 in. Corded WorxSaw,"The WX429L WorxSaw can essentially replace a DIYer's need for a full-size 7-1/4 in. circular saw. This saw was born to cut wood, especially 2 in. nominal lumber materials. This saw weighs only 4.5 lbs., so it is easy to transport and maneuver. The grip and safety trigger provides great comfort, balance and control. The 4-1/2 in. blade cuts 2X4s in a single pass and is about 50% lighter than conventional 7-1/4 in. circular saws. Plus, the lightweight saw's left-sided blade design provides remarkable cut-line visibility. The saw's 4-1/2 in. blade has a kerf that is less than half the Thickness: of larger 7-1/4 in. circular saw blades. Since this smaller, thinner blade takes much less effort and motor strain to cut through the material, the 4 Amp - 3500 RPM saw can match the performance of full-size circular saws.

307288231,XSH06PT1,18-Volt X2 LXT Lithium-Ion (36-Volt) Brushless Cordless 7-1/4 in. Circular Saw Kit with 4 Batteries (5.0Ah),"Makita, a pioneer in brushless motor technology and battery innovation, combines both in the 18-Volt X2 LXT (36-Volt) Lithium-Ion Brushless 7-1/4 Circular Saw Kit (XSH06PT1). It's powered by two 18-Volt LXT Lithium-Ion batteries for maximum performance, and has an electronically-controlled BL Brushless motor that matches torque and RPM to the application. Makita 18-Volt X2 means freedom from the cord, even for demanding applications like cutting sheet and dimensional lumber that traditionally called for a corded saw. Best of all, users can remain in one battery platform, using the same fast-charging 18-Volt batteries with the XSH06PT1 as they use across the expansive Makita 18-Volt LXT cordless tool system. The XSH06PT1 has a long list of features for efficient cutting without the cord. The electronically-controlled brushless motor delivers a full 6,000 RPM for efficient cutting, with Automatic Speed Change technology to adjust the cutting speed and torque under load for optimum performance. In internal testing, the XSH06PT1 made up to 600 cross-cuts per charge in 2x4 SPF lumber using two fully-charged 5.0Ah batteries.

310735605,CT1065,10 Amp 6.5 in. Plunge Cut Sidewinder Circular Track Saw,"Remember when your saw stayed on the right track. Keep your cuts on the straight and narrow with the WEN 10 Amp Sidewinder Plunge Cut Track Saw. The WEN Track Saw provides users the same results as a table or panel saw in a compact and portable package. Simply lay the track (not included model CT9980) along the desired surface for a clean and smooth cut. The WEN Track Saw is the perfect companion for ripping plywood, trimming doors, building furniture and any other application needing long, precise cuts. Our powerful 10 Amp motor rotates the 6-1/2 in. blade up to 5500 times per minute, letting you power through even the hardest of woods. Bevel the saw 45° to the left to create angled cuts in boards up to 1-5/8 in. thick. Set the depth gauge anywhere from 0 to 2-1/3 in. to control how deep the saw plunges. The 12 in. x 6-5/8 in. base features precision grooves that let the saw glide smoothly along the track. However, the saw can also exist on its own as a plunge saw, relying on its flat base for maximum stability and precision. Easily switch between 3 different blade settings: 1 for scoring cuts that go 1/8 in. D, 1 for full plunge cuts and 1 to simplify blade changes. The back-mounted dust port allows for attachment to your favorite dust collection system to control sawdust and limit cleanup. Simply attach your dust collection device of choice and start sawing.

305967919,WX523L,Worxsaw 20-Volt 3-3/8 in. Compact Circular Saw,"The WX523L 20-Volt WORXSAW is an entry point cordless saw for the beginner DIY'er or a second saw for the small projects. This saw was born to cut wood, especially 1 in. nominal lumber materials. This saw weighs only 4-1/2 lbs., so it is easy to transport and maneuver. The grip and safety trigger provide great comfort, balance and control. The 3-3/8 in. blade cuts all 1X material and is the lightest circular saw. Plus, the lightweight saw's left-sided blade design provides remarkable cut-line visibility. The saw's 3-3/8 in. blade has a kerf that is less than half the thickness of larger 7-1/4 in. circular saw blades.

302781709,KMA2685,24 in. Rip-Cut Aluminum Circular Saw Guide,"The Kreg rip-cut turns your circular saw into a precision edge-guided cutting tool that makes straight, accurate, repeatable cuts in plywood, MDF and other large sheets. With the rip-cut, you can cut with the confidence you want and the precision you need. The rip-cut easily makes straight, accurate, repeatable cuts without measuring, marking or having to keep the saw on the cut line. The rip-cut does this with a long edge guide that follows the straight edge of the sheet you are cutting. So, all you have to do is lock the saw in at the measurement you want up to 24 in. using the built-in measuring scale and then make your cut. With a built-in measuring scale, you don't have to measure and mark each cut, either. Just lock the saw sled at your desired cut width and you're all set, whether you need to cut 1-piece or make multiple pieces of the exact same size. Plus, the rip-cut makes it easier to cut down large sheets by yourself. The rip-cut is very easy to use. Simply mount your saw to the universal sled it accepts most left-blade or right-blade saw-sand then slide the sled onto the aluminum rail. After a simple 1-time calibration, you can lock in your cut width (up to 24 in.) using the measuring scale and precision cursor. Then, just hold the edge guide against the edge of your sheet as you guide the saw. You will get straight, accurate, repeatable cuts easily every time.","Bullet05 : Eliminate need for marking, measuring and layout lines,Bullet06 : Take your saw to the material instead of having to take your material to the saw,Bullet04 : Use the oversize edge guide for precise control throughout the cut,MFG Brand Name : Kreg,Bullet03 : Cut multiple pieces to the same size with just 1-setup,Bullet07 : Universal sled accepts most circular saw left or right blade,Bullet02 : Make rip cuts and crosscuts up to 24 in.

302781729,KMA2700,48 in. Accu-Cut Aluminum Circular Saw Track,"Start projects right by making straight, accurate, splinter-free cuts with your circular saw and the accu-cut circular saw guide track system. It rips, crosscuts and makes angled cuts up to 48 in. long in plywood, MDF and other large panels with super-simple setup, precise accuracy and amazing control. The accu-cut guides your circular saw along an aluminum track that keeps the saw moving in a straight line easily. The accu-cut design makes it simple to set up by just aligning the track with your cut line. No clamps are required to hold the track in place thanks to dual guide strips. They feature an anti-slip coating to prevent slipping and an anti-chip feature to prevent splintered cuts. Plus, the track makes it easy to make straight cuts on sheets that don't have a straight, flat edge. Circular saws don't have effective guides that keep them moving straight along a cut line. Plus, it can be difficult to see the blades cutting path. Together, these things make it challenging to keep a saw on your desired cut. Circular saws also often cause splintering of face veneers. The accu-cut solves these problems. The accu-cut is portable, too, so you can take your saw to the work-piece and cut with precision, rather than having to handle heavy sheets on a table saw. The accu-cut is easy and intuitive for a novice to use, but robust enough for professionals.","Bullet08 : Take your saw to the material instead of having to take your material to the saw,Bullet04 : Hold track in place without clamps thanks to anti-slip guide strips,Bullet02 : Rip, crosscut and make angled cuts up to 48 in.

305967919,WX523L,Worxsaw 20-Volt 3-3/8 in. Compact Circular Saw,"The WX523L 20-Volt WORXSAW is an entry point cordless saw for the beginner DIY'er or a second saw for the small projects. This saw was born to cut wood, especially 1 in. nominal lumber materials. This saw weighs only 4-1/2 lbs., so it is easy to transport and maneuver. The grip and safety trigger provide great comfort, balance and control. The 3-3/8 in. blade cuts all 1X material and is the lightest circular saw. Plus, the lightweight saw's left-sided blade design provides remarkable cut-line visibility. The saw's 3-3/8 in. blade has a kerf that is less than half the thickness of larger 7-1/4 in. circular saw blades.

206300133,WX429L,4 Amp 4-1/2 in. Corded WorxSaw,"The WX429L WorxSaw can essentially replace a DIYer's need for a full-size 7-1/4 in. circular saw. This saw was born to cut wood, especially 2 in. nominal lumber materials. This saw weighs only 4.5 lbs., so it is easy to transport and maneuver. The grip and safety trigger provides great comfort, balance and control. The 4-1/2 in. blade cuts 2X4s in a single pass and is about 50% lighter than conventional 7-1/4 in. circular saws. Plus, the lightweight saw's left-sided blade design provides remarkable cut-line visibility. The saw's 4-1/2 in. blade has a kerf that is less than half the Thickness: of larger 7-1/4 in. circular saw blades. Since this smaller, thinner blade takes much less effort and motor strain to cut through the material, the 4 Amp - 3500 RPM saw can match the performance of full-size circular saws. The saw's maximum cutting depth at 90° is 1-11/16 in. and the bevel capacity at 45° is 1-1/8 in. The saw also features a dust extraction port and a 1-1/4 in. vacuum adapter for dust collection and a clean work environment.","Bullet04 : Left-sided blade design for great cut-line visibility,Bullet02 : Grip with integrated safety trigger for comfort, balance, and control,Bullet23 : <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/c/electronics_recycling_programs style=color:#F96302; target=_blank>Click here for more information on Electronic Recycling Programs</a>,Bullet05 : Bevel adjustment for 0°-45°bevel cutting capabilities,Bullet22 : <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_3c.jpg""></center><br /> <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_4_Edit.jpg""></center><br />,Bullet01 : Small, compact size for excellent maneuverability and portability,Bullet21 : <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_3a.jpg""></center><br /> <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_3b.jpg""></center><br />,Bullet20 : <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_1_Edit.jpg""></center><br /> <br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/POSITEC USA/WX429L_Amazon_Module_2.jpg""></center><br />,Bullet03 : Exceptional depth-of-cut for cutting 2 in. stock lumber,Bullet06 : Dust port for dust vac hookup and a clean work environment,MFG Brand Name : Worx",49.99 / 49.99,"Product Highlight 3 : Safety trigger provides great control and an easy grip,Product Highlight 1 : Perfect for cutting 2 in. nominal wood,Product Highlight 2 : Lightweight design makes it easy to maneuver and transport",4.6253,"https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/18748f96-f640-438e-8c00-49ac6d0149bd/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-64_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/88eb17b1-7c7a-4203-8b9a-50484599ede9/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-e1_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/b9ef713b-d979-4827-bddd-6929ae6a506f/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-40_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/cb96d85e-8983-4e99-b2ee-1b804c48b681/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-a0_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/e12dec26-dd7c-4740-ae2b-9e88bfffa1c8/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-1d_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/fa02a33f-461b-49aa-93f0-ad3603117a97/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-66_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/5974f786-e4df-4309-bba2-cbc568dd2951/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-77_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/27c51bed-369a-43af-af4d-5cb6e70b377e/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-c3_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/d18ac8b9-29c9-4059-b087-ecb0a376f75c/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-4f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/1f3ca937-d62c-4088-aaa1-91ff434aa1ad/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-1f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/1f3ca937-d62c-4088-aaa1-91ff434aa1ad/svn/worx-circular-saws-wx429l-44_1000.jpg","Blade Location : Left,Included Accessories : Blades,Returnable : 90-Day,Power Tool Features : Depth Adjustment,Electric Brake,Keyed Blade Change,Spindle Lock,Saw Drive Type : Sidewinder,Amperage (amps) : 4,Bevel Capacity : 45,Cordless/ Corded : Corded,Blade Diameter (in.) : 4-1/2,Tools Product Type : Power Tool,Depth Adjustment : No,Color Family : Black,Construction Material : Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS),Cord Length (ft.) : 5,Condition : New,Corded Tool Type : Circular Saw,Maximum Cut Depth @ 45 Deg. : 1.2,Cuts Through : Aluminum,PVC,Plastic,Wood,Maximum Speed (rpm) : 3500,Product Weight (lb.) : 4.25,Maximum Cut Depth @ 90 Deg. : 1.8,Product Depth (in.) : 18.25,Product Height (in.) : 4.375,Product Width (in.) : 4.875,Blade Diameter : 4-1/2,Manufacturer Warranty : 3 years limited,Certifications and Listings : ETL Classified","Use and Care Manual : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/56/56676216-e260-48bb-b75f-40a09b7fa48f.pdf,Replacement Part List : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/f5/f5780cb8-9b00-4350-8e64-ac208a45cff9.pdf,Warranty : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/0e/0e28a64d-a7a5-47c2-8643-c0aa91e8f4a0.pdf"

307288231,XSH06PT1,18-Volt X2 LXT Lithium-Ion (36-Volt) Brushless Cordless 7-1/4 in. Circular Saw Kit with 4 Batteries (5.0Ah),"Makita, a pioneer in brushless motor technology and battery innovation, combines both in the 18-Volt X2 LXT (36-Volt) Lithium-Ion Brushless 7-1/4 Circular Saw Kit (XSH06PT1). It's powered by two 18-Volt LXT Lithium-Ion batteries for maximum performance, and has an electronically-controlled BL Brushless motor that matches torque and RPM to the application. Makita 18-Volt X2 means freedom from the cord, even for demanding applications like cutting sheet and dimensional lumber that traditionally called for a corded saw. Best of all, users can remain in one battery platform, using the same fast-charging 18-Volt batteries with the XSH06PT1 as they use across the expansive Makita 18-Volt LXT cordless tool system. The XSH06PT1 has a long list of features for efficient cutting without the cord. The electronically-controlled brushless motor delivers a full 6,000 RPM for efficient cutting, with Automatic Speed Change technology to adjust the cutting speed and torque under load for optimum performance. In internal testing, the XSH06PT1 made up to 600 cross-cuts per charge in 2x4 SPF lumber using two fully-charged 5.0Ah batteries. Added features include a large 2-11/16 cutting capacity at 90°, and an electric brake for maximum productivity. The saw has a die-cast magnesium base and blade guard with die-cast aluminum blade cover and motor housing, which combines durability with less weight (only 10.4 lbs. with batteries, sold separately).","Bullet22 : <br /><br /><center><a href=""https://www.homedepot.com/s/Makita%2520LXT?NCNI-5."" target=""_blank""><br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/MAKITA USA INC/LXT Updated Inline Content_4.11.2019.jpg""></center><br /></a></center><br />,Bullet12 : Extreme Protection Technology (XPT) is engineered for improved dust and water resistance for operation in harsh conditions,Bullet01 : Powered by 2 LXT batteries;

Any cut is possible, even bevel or inside plunge cuts. It's as easy as connecting the dots. Attach a vacuum to collect up to 90% of the dust and minimize cleanup.","Bullet03 : Straight plunge mechanism for optimal ergonomics,Bullet23 : <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/c/electronics_recycling_programs style=color:#F96302; target=_blank>Click here for more information on Electronic Recycling Programs</a>,Bullet06 : Universal 1-1/4 in. dust port for 90% efficient dust collection with vacuum,Bullet01 : Includes DWS520K 6-1/2 in.
