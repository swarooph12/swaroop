303408210,XCU03PT1,14 in. 18-Volt X2 (36-Volt) LXT Lithium-Ion Brushless Cordless Chain Saw Kit with Four 5.0 Ah Batteries and Charger,"Landscapers and contractors are demanding more cordless alternatives to corded and gas-powered outdoor power equipment. Makita is meeting demand with an expanding line of cordless OPE, including the 18V X2 LXT (36V) Brushless Chain Saw Kit (model XCU03PT1). With zero emissions, lower noise, and considerably less maintenance, the Chain Saw is a welcome solution for cutting and trimming applications. Its powered by two 18V LXT batteries for 36V power and run time, but without leaving the strongly-preferred 18V battery platform. And with the efficient Makita outer rotor brushless motor with direct drive system, users get high power efficiency that is equivalent to a gas chain saw. The Chain Saw has a 14 guide bar and the Makita-built motor with variable speed delivers 0-3,940 FPM for increased cutting speed, but with less noise (only 100dB(A)). It has zero emissions and reduced maintenance: there's no engine oil to change, no spark plug to replace, and no air filter or muffler to clean. And there's no need to drain the fuel for storage. Simply pick it up, load two 18V LXT Lithium-Ion batteries, and the saw is ready to use. Convenience features include a ""tool-less"" chain adjustments, a front hand guard engineered to actuate chain brake when engaged, an electric brake for maximum productivity, and more. Model XCU03PT1 is a kit and includes the Chain Saw, four fast-charging 18V LXT Lithium-Ion 5.0Ah batteries and an efficient 18V Dual Port Rapid Optimum Charger.","Bullet22 : <br /><br /><center><a href=""https://www.homedepot.com/s/Makita%2520LXT?NCNI-5."" target=""_blank""><br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/MAKITA USA INC/LXT Updated Inline Content_4.11.2019.jpg""></center><br /></a></center><br />,Bullet08 : 14 in. guide bar for increased capacity,Bullet14 : Large oil filling port with view window allows operator to easily add and check bar oil level,Bullet10 : Weighs only 11.5 lbs. with batteries for reduced operator fatigue,Bullet03 : Tool-less chain adjustment for convenient operation and maintenance,Bullet17 : 18-Volt LXT lithium-ion 5.0 Ah battery BL1850B features an integrated L.E.D. battery charge level indicator,Bullet07 : Front hand guard engineered to actuate chain brake when engaged,Bullet04 : Built-in lock-off lever helps prevent the chain from accidentally engaging,Bullet16 : L.E.D. battery indicators show charge level for each 18-Volt LXT battery,Bullet12 : Electric brake for maximum productivity,Bullet05 : Built-in L.E.D. on/off switch with auto power-off function, automatically shuts the saw off when operation is delayed for extended battery life,Bullet15 : Adjustable automatic chain lubrication with large oil reservoir,Bullet13 : Rubberized soft grip top handle is engineered for the user to more easily apply even cutting pressure,Bullet23 : <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/c/electronics_recycling_programs style=color:#F96302;

303718088,XCU04PT,16 in. 18-Volt X2 (36-Volt) LXT Lithium-Ion Brushless Cordless Chain Saw Kit (5.0Ah),"Landscapers and contractors are demanding more cordless alternatives to corded and gas-powered outdoor power equipment. Makita is meeting demand with an expanding line of cordless OPE, including the 18-Volt X2 LXT (36-Volt) Brushless 18 in. Chain Saw (model XCU04PT). With zero emissions, lower noise, and considerably less maintenance, the XCU04PT is a welcome solution for cutting and trimming applications. Its powered by two 18-Volt LXT batteries for maximum power, speed and run-time, but without leaving the strongly-preferred 18-Volt battery platform. And with the efficient Makita outer rotor brushless motor with direct drive system, users get high power efficiency that is equivalent to a gas chain saw. The XCU04PT has a 16 in. guide bar and the Makita-built Outer Rotor BL Brushless Motor direct drive system motor with variable speed delivers 0-3,940 FPM for increased cutting speed.

Makita is meeting demand with an expanding line of cordless OPE, including the 18-Volt X2 LXT (36-Volt) Brushless Chain Saw. With zero emissions, lower noise, and considerably less maintenance, it is a welcome solution for cutting and trimming applications. It's powered by two 18-Volt LXT batteries for maximum power and run time, but without leaving the 18-Volt battery platform. And with the efficient Makita outer rotor brushless motor with direct drive system, users get high power efficiency that is equivalent to a gas chain saw. Model XCU03PTX1 is a kit and includes the Chain Saw, two fast-charging 18-Volt LXT Lithium-Ion 5.0Ah batteries and an efficient 18-Volt Dual Port Rapid Optimum Charger, as well as an 18-Volt LXT Brushless 4-1/2 in. Paddle Switch Angle Grinder that is engineered for corded grinding performance without the cord. The Chain Saw has a 14 in. guide bar and the Makita-built motor with variable speed delivers 0-3,940 FPM for increased cutting speed, but with less noise (only 100dB(A)). It has zero emissions and reduced maintenance: there's no engine oil to change, no spark plug to replace, and no air filter or muffler to clean. And there's no need to drain the fuel for storage.

205400602,XCU02Z,12 in. 18-Volt X2 (36-Volt) LXT Lithium-Ion Cordless Chain Saw (Tool-Only),"The 18-Volt X2 LXT Chain Saw (model XCU02Z) is powered by two 18-Volt LXT batteries (36-Volt), so you get 36-Volt power and run time for corded and gas-powered demands, without leaving the 18-Volt LXT platform. Batteries and charger are sold separately. For improved tool performance and extended battery life, Makita created Star Protection Computer Controls. Star Protection is communication technology that allows the Star Protection-equipped tool and battery to exchange data in real time and monitor conditions during use to protect against overloading, over-discharging and overheating. For increased versatility, the tool can also be powered by Makita 18-Volt LXT and Compact Lithium-Ion batteries with the star symbol on the battery indicating Star Protection inside. The XCU02Z Chain Saw has a 12 in. guide bar and the Makita-built motor delivers 1,650 FPM for increased cutting speed, but with less noise (only 89dB(A)). The cordless XCU02Z has zero emissions and reduced maintenance: there's no engine oil to change, no spark plug to replace, and no air filter or muffler to clean. And there's no need to drain the fuel for storage. Simply pickup your XCU02Z, load two 18-Volt LXT Lithium-Ion batteries, and the saw is ready to use. Additional features include a tool-less chain adjustments, a front hand guard engineered to actuate chain brake when engaged, an electric brake for maximum productivity, and more.","Bullet11 : Instant start-up: simply load two 18-Volt LXT batteries and the saw is ready to use,Bullet22 : <br /><br /><center><a href=""https://www.homedepot.com/s/Makita%2520LXT?NCNI-5."" target=""_blank""><br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/MAKITA USA INC/LXT Updated Inline Content_4.11.2019.jpg""></center><br /></a></center><br />,Bullet04 : 12 in. guide bar for increased capacity,Bullet16 : Batteries and charger sold separately,Bullet14 : Large oil filling port with view window allows operator to easily add and check bar oil level,Bullet21 : <br /><br /><center><a href=""https://www.homedepot.com/b/Outdoors-Outdoor-Power-Equipment-Chainsaws-Chainsaw-Parts-Chainsaw-Chains/12-in/3-8-in/46/043-in/N-5yc1vZbxadZ1z0lcdzZ1z1ban0Z1z1bapcZ1z1bgtx"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/28I/Chainsaw Replacement Chain Project/replacement-chains-pips.jpg""></a></center><br />,Bullet07 : Cordless for reduced maintenance, no need to change engine oil or spark plug, clean air filter or drain fuel for storage,Bullet01 : Makita-built motor delivers 1,650 FPM chain speed for fast cutting,Bullet06 : Front hand guard actuates chain brake when engaged,Bullet13 : Adjustable automatic chain lubrication with large oil reservoir,Bullet12 : Electric brake for maximum productivity,Bullet05 : Tool-less chain adjustment for convenient operation and maintenance,Bullet17 : 3-year warranty on tool,Bullet03 : Low noise level at only 89dB (A) and zero emissions for operator comfort,Bullet10 : Rubberized soft grip top handle is engineered for the user to more easily apply even cutting pressure,Bullet23 : <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/c/electronics_recycling_programs style=color:#F96302;
