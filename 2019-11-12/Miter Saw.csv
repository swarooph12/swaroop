204668975,CM10GD,15 Amp Corded 10 in. Dual-Bevel Sliding Glide Miter Saw with 60-Tooth Carbide Saw Blade,"The innovation responsible for both the unique appearance and the unparalleled level of performance of the Bosch 10 in. Dual Bevel Glide Miter Saw is Bosch's patented Axial-Glide System. Beyond giving the saw its distinctive profile, Bosch's Axial-Glide System eliminates three key challenges miter saw users have endured since the first slide systems debuted many years ago. While the traditional sliding compound miter saw approach enables users to make wider cross cuts that system takes up more space and is prone to misalignment and stickiness over time. By replacing the sliding rail system with a hinged or articulating glide arm system similar to the linkage used in a four-bar suspension design Bosch created a more compact miter saw that delivers durable precision, remaining true and smooth over time.","MFG Brand Name : Bosch,Bullet06 : Includes: 10 in. 60-tooth blades, material clamp, dust bag,Bullet05 : Large easy-to-read uniform bevel and stainless-steel miter scales: 52° left/60° right miter capacity; 47° left/47° right bevel capacity with marked detents and roof pitch angles,Bullet09 : Bevel detents: 0°, 33.9°, 45° left/right for accurate cuts,Bullet08 : Push-button miter detent override easy-to-access thumb actuated control right up front for fine miter angle adjustment,Bullet23 : <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/c/electronics_recycling_programs style=color:#F96302; target=_blank>Click here for more information on Electronic Recycling Programs</a>,Bullet04 : Tall sliding 4-1/4 in. fences: for easy bevel setups and increased crown and base molding capacity,Bullet03 : Chop/crown lock: locks head in place for maximum chop cutting capacity for upright base molding and nested crown molding,Bullet07 : Adjustable miter detents: detents at 0°, 15°, 31.6°, 22.5°, 45°, 60° right super-accurate and durable design,Bullet10 : Category best 90% dust collection optimized for cutting 2X material with a vacuum,Bullet01 : Expanded cutting capacity: 12 in. horizontal capacity (nominal); 5-1/2 in. vertical capacity against the fence (base); 6 in. crown capacity against the fence (45° spring),Bullet11 : Ergonomic ambidextrous trigger handle with soft grip large form fitting ergonomic handle provides comfort for all-day use,Bullet02 : Upfront bevel controls all-metal bevel lock lever and range selector located upfront for quick and easy bevel settings without reaching behind the saw",544.99 / 544.99,"Product Highlight 2 : Upfront metal bevel controls and SquareLock precision fences,Product Highlight 3 : Includes 10 in. 60-tooth carbide-tipped blade, dust bag, wrench,Product Highlight 1 : Axial-Glide system allows wider cross cuts and better alignment",4.4659,"https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/be478759-be0f-4ecd-bda2-48f67ffe6da2/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-64_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/0dce660f-710a-4609-abfc-332959933291/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-e1_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/9d72aa44-d976-4499-b640-96ad6499ebd9/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-40_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/2adf1ec4-cfdf-4d52-8e57-ad761763982d/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-a0_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/547388ad-2dcf-4272-b459-918991c160b0/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-1d_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/84db9a04-448e-4dd8-99aa-5809d4eaaf78/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-66_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/4b055c44-18fa-4893-93c2-7e71a96a776e/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-77_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/834d3178-73d4-4a38-9bc3-c7527c8350a2/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-c3_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/7aa819f6-74d4-479e-b27f-f3d14386f08d/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-4f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/b427c83c-1a92-405f-b85e-6c4a2e5f5ae0/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-76_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/7e94925e-c75d-456e-8e30-601d45f92255/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-d4_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/2cc82590-6dea-405b-a1c5-c2610a6f3ac2/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-31_1000.jpg","Arbor Size : 0.625,Dust Collection Method : Bag,Miter Saw Type : Sliding Compound,90 Degree Crosscut Capacity Maximum - Right : 4 x 12,Returnable : 90-Day,Maximum Speed (rpm) : 4800,Color Family : Blue,Blade Diameter (in.) : 10,Amperage (amps) : 15,Cordless/ Corded : Corded,Condition : New,Cord Length (ft.) : 6,Construction Material : Aluminum,Portability : Bench,90 Degree Crosscut Capacity Maximum - Left : 4 x 12,Bevel Type : Dual,Product Weight (lb.) : 64,Maximum Degree Miter Cuts - Left : 52,Maximum Degree Miter Cuts - Right : 60,Maximum Cutting Thickness (in.) : 6,45 Degree Crosscut Capacity Maximum : 3.25 x 12.5,Tools Product Type : Power Tool,Power Tool Features : Electric Brake,Positive Stops,Bench & Stationary Tool Type : Slide Miter Saw,Included Accessories : Allen Key/Wrench,Table Width (in.) : 27,Product Width (in.) : 26.5,Table Length (in.) : 13.75,Product Depth (in.) : 32,Product Height (in.) : 20.5,Certifications and Listings : 1-UL Listed,Manufacturer Warranty : Limited 1 Year","Warranty : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/5b/5bc363fb-49a2-4e84-ac50-0f953200694c.pdf,Use and Care Manual : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/14/144329c9-e808-4138-8030-937890fb6dcc.pdf"

304166235,70730,2-Speed Single Bevel 10 in. Sliding Compound Miter Saw with Smart Power Technology,"Remember when you could cut through a board full of nails. We aren’t kidding. You can literally slice through a wooden board full of metal nails with the WEN 2-Speed Single Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw. This saw’s smart power technology implements an internal speed detection system to maintain consistent RPMs through materials of varying hardness. That means the saw’s torque automatically adjusts, increasing when sawing through knots and nails and decreasing for softer portions of the work piece. Combine that with our 15-Amp motor for a versatile tool that can handle even the toughest of projects. With the WEN 2-Speed Miter Saw, you can select your preferred speed with the simple flick of a switch for operation at either 2000 or 4500 rotations per minute. Switch on a metal-cutting blade to take on aluminum, steel and more. Bevel the head of the saw up to 45° to the left and miter up to 45° in either direction. Cut boards up to 12 in. wide and 3-1/2 in. thick or make compound cuts (45° bevel and 45° miter) 8-1/2 in. wide and 1-7/8 in. thick.

While the traditional sliding compound miter saw approach enables users to make wider cross cuts that system takes up more space and is prone to misalignment and stickiness over time. By replacing the sliding rail system with a hinged or articulating glide arm system similar to the linkage used in a four-bar suspension design Bosch created a more compact miter saw that delivers durable precision, remaining true and smooth over time. Includes bonus T4B Folding-Leg Miter Saw Stand. The Bosch T4B gravity-rise miter saw stand features the patented gravity rise system and rapid set up and breakdown. It has an 18 in. material capacity which is the highest capacity among fully portable units. It has 8 in. pneumatic wheels which facilitate ease of transport over jobsite terrain. The stand also features rapid release tool mounts, adjustable leveling feet for stability on uneven surfaces and it also fits most competitors' miter saws. Bosch bench top tools provide the precision and performance your projects require. Durable quality is not only in every tool, but the trust you have in Bosch bench top tools.","MFG Brand Name : Bosch,Bullet08 : CM10GD: push-button miter detent override easy-to-access thumb actuated control right up front for fine miter angle adjustment,Bullet07 : CM10GD: adjustable miter detents: detents at 0, 15, 31.6, 22.5, 45, 60 right super-accurate and durable design,Bullet10 : CM10GD: category best 90% dust collection optimized for cutting 2x material with a vacuum,Bullet15 : T4B: adjustable height out feed of up to 12 in.,Bullet04 : CM10GD: tall sliding 4-1/4 in. fences: for easy bevel setups and increased crown and base molding capacity,Bullet16 : T4B: Includes gravity rise miter saw stand with wheels and universal rapid-release tool mounts,Bullet09 : CM10GD: bevel detents: 0, 33.9, 45 left/right for accurate cuts,Bullet13 : T4B: expansion rails expands material support up to 16 ft.,Bullet23 : <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/c/electronics_recycling_programs style=color:#F96302; target=_blank>Click here for more information on Electronic Recycling Programs</a>,Bullet14 : T4B: integrated rubber wheels easily move stand with saw attached from jobsite to jobsite,Bullet02 : CM10GD: upfront bevel controls all-metal bevel lock lever and range selector located upfront for quick and easy bevel settings without reaching behind the saw,Bullet11 : CM10GD: ergonomic ambidextrous trigger handle with soft grip large form fitting ergonomic handle provides comfort for all-day use,Bullet05 : CM10GD: large easy-to-read uniform bevel and stainless-steel miter scales: 52 left/60 right miter capacity; 47 left/47 right bevel capacity with marked detents and roof pitch angles,Bullet06 : CM10GD: includes: 10 in. 60-tooth blades, material clamp, dust bag,Bullet12 : T4B: universal rapid-release tool mounts fits most competitors' tools,Bullet01 : CM10GD: expanded cutting capacity: 12 in. horizontal capacity (nominal); 5-1/2 in. vertical capacity against the fence (base); 6 in. crown capacity against the fence (45 spring),Bullet03 : CM10GD: chop/crown lock: locks head in place for maximum chop cutting capacity for upright base molding and nested crown molding",948.0 / 948.0,"Product Highlight 2 : Upfront metal bevel controls and SquareLock precision fences,Product Highlight 3 : Includes bonus T4B folding-leg miter saw stand,Product Highlight 1 : Axial-Glide system allows wider cross cuts and better alignment",4.732,"https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/eee0c121-a76f-4205-97a8-b98850a9242d/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-64_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/4e8f4418-6f16-4584-af48-1a36f05a4a47/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-c3_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/b8825b76-947d-4135-abf4-62008aa877a9/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-4f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/deef1557-d8e8-4521-a6c3-0dd4bc33d2b9/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-1f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/df7eb3ee-4ae3-4be9-bb96-6e6dc27d49bd/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-44_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/c1e6b987-999f-47cf-b7d8-9d44f9418cdd/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-fa_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/6d80d420-8f1e-4c58-9d24-449731ab80b2/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-76_1000.jpg","Arbor Size : 0.625,Miter Saw Type : Sliding Compound,Cuts Through : Wood,Returnable : 90-Day,Bevel Type : Dual,Color Family : Blue,Maximum Degree Miter Cuts - Left : 52,Power Tool Features : Electric Brake,Keyed Blade Change,Positive Stops,Maximum Degree Miter Cuts - Right : 60,Blade Diameter (in.) : 10,Corded Tool Type : Miter Saw,Power Source : Electric,Maximum Cutting Thickness (in.) : 6,Cordless/ Corded : Corded,Tools Product Type : Power Tool,Product Weight (lb.) : 64 lb,Condition : New,Cord Length (ft.) : 6,Dust collection type : Bag,Construction Material : Aluminum,Amperage (amps) : 15 A,Included Accessories : Allen Key/Wrench,Product Width (in.) : 26.5 in,Product Height (in.) : 20.5 in,Product Depth (in.) : 32 in,Certifications and Listings : 1-UL Listed,Manufacturer Warranty : Limited 1 Year","Use and Care Manual : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/0d/0d7b0cf7-137b-4ab9-a670-2fcfaa69bcb6.pdf,Warranty : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/cc/cce4938a-9602-4858-82df-b6777f00ff5e.pdf"

307417361,CM10GD+GTA3800,15 Amp Corded 10 in. Dual-Bevel Sliding Glide Miter Saw with 60-Tooth Saw Blade with Bonus 32-1/2 in. Folding Leg Stand,"The innovation responsible for both the unique appearance and the unparalleled level of performance of the Bosch CM10GD 10 in. Dual Bevel Glide Miter Saw is Bosch's patented Axial-Glide System. Beyond giving the saw its distinctive profile, Bosch's Axial-Glide System eliminates three key challenges miter saw users have endured since the first slide systems debuted many years ago. While the traditional sliding compound miter saw approach enables users to make wider cross cuts that system takes up more space and is prone to misalignment and stickiness over time. By replacing the sliding rail system with a hinged or articulating glide arm system similar to the linkage used in a four-bar suspension design Bosch created a more compact miter saw that delivers durable precision, remaining true and smooth over time. Includes bonus GTA3800 Portable Folding Leg Miter Saw Stand.

307397357,CM10GD+T1B,15 Amp Corded 10 in Dual-Bevel Sliding Glide Miter Saw with 60-Tooth Carbide Saw Blade and Bonus Folding-Leg Stand,"The innovation responsible for both the unique appearance and the unparalleled level of performance of the Bosch CM10GD 10 in. Dual Bevel Glide Miter Saw is Bosch's patented Axial-Glide System. Beyond giving the saw its distinctive profile, Bosch's Axial-Glide System eliminates three key challenges miter saw users have endured since the first slide systems debuted many years ago. While the traditional sliding compound miter saw approach enables users to make wider cross cuts that system takes up more space and is prone to misalignment and stickiness over time. By replacing the sliding rail system with a hinged or articulating glide arm system similar to the linkage used in a four-bar suspension design Bosch created a more compact miter saw that delivers durable precision, remaining true and smooth over time. Includes bonus T1B Folding-Leg Miter Saw Stand. The Bosch T1B Folding-Leg Miter Saw Stand features Universal Quick-Action Tool Mounts, to fit most miter saws on the market. This includes fitting Bosch 12 In., 10 in. and 8-1/2 in. single- and dual-bevel miter saws, as well as many competitor miter saws. Once attached to the saw mounts, users can attach and remove the miter saw from the stand without tools. The stand has smooth material supports that are adjustable in height to match the height of the user's miter saw. It also features integrated repetitive stops.

308561342,XSL06Z-DC18RD,18-Volt X2 LXT Brushless 10 in. Dual-Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw with Bonus 18-Volt LXT Dual Port Rapid Charger,"Makita is a pioneer in brushless motor engineering, battery technology and miter saw innovation and has combined this expertise in the 18-Volt X2 LXT (36-Volt) Lithium-Ion Brushless 10 in. Dual Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw (tool only, batteries and charger sold separately). It's powered by two 18-Volt Lithium-Ion batteries for 36-Volt power and performance, but without leaving the 18-Volt LXT platform. Makita brushless motors are engineered for up to 50% longer run time, increased power and speed and longer tool life. The XSL06Z has a unique 2-steel rail sliding system design that offers single slide-glide operation for smooth and dead-on accurate cutting right out of the box, as well as a reduced overall footprint that allows the saw to be positioned flush against a wall. The innovative direct-drive gearbox and guard system is engineered for increased vertical cutting capacity (5-1/4 in.) and crown molding cutting capacity (6-5/8 in. nested), the largest in its class. It will also crosscut a 4x12 at 90°. The saw miters 0 to 60 left and right, with positive stops at 0, 15, 22.5, 31.6, 45 and 60 (left or right). The bevel lock is located in the front of the saw for easy access and quick adjustments from 0 to 48 (left and right). The direct drive gearbox with soft start is a key point of difference. Direct drive enables smoother start-ups and consistent, constant power with no belts to slip or replace.","Bullet22 : <br /><br /><center><a href=""https://www.homedepot.com/s/Makita%2520LXT?NCNI-5."" target=""_blank""><br /><br /><center><img src=""https://inlinecontent.homedepot-static.com/25T/MAKITA USA INC/LXT Updated Inline Content_4.11.2019.jpg""></center><br /></a></center><br />,Bullet09 : Increased capacity for up to 6-5/8 in. crown molding (vertically nested), 5-1/4 in. baseboard (vertical) and 12 in. crosscuts at 90°,Bullet01 : Powered by 2 LXT batteries;

301298048,PM-8000,Portacube STR Miter Saw Workstation,"The ultimate miter saw table / workstation is here with Bora Portamate's new Portacube Miter Saw Work Station. It's a solid, stable miter saw bench that lets you securely mount you saw for various projects. But the real magic happens with the features - 2 side wings fold out and lock into place, turning your 30 in. saw table into a 60 in. or 90 in. workbench. The wings also have adjustable middle sections, so they align perfectly with your saw's height. And when you aren't using the table for cutting, the center portion flips over and locks, giving you a clear, stable work area, all while you saw stays attached, upside down and out of the way. There are also 3/4 in. dog holes for pegs to help hold your machine in place. Ingenious, right. This work station satisfies every need. If you need a rolling saw table, it's that. If you need a portable workbench, it's that. If you sometimes need extensions, but sometimes need compact, it's that. And if you want a place to keep you saw forever, yet still use it for other things, it's that too. Of course, it's fully portable, with 10 in. locking wheels and convenient handle.

304166235,70730,2-Speed Single Bevel 10 in. Sliding Compound Miter Saw with Smart Power Technology,"Remember when you could cut through a board full of nails. We aren’t kidding. You can literally slice through a wooden board full of metal nails with the WEN 2-Speed Single Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw. This saw’s smart power technology implements an internal speed detection system to maintain consistent RPMs through materials of varying hardness. That means the saw’s torque automatically adjusts, increasing when sawing through knots and nails and decreasing for softer portions of the work piece. Combine that with our 15-Amp motor for a versatile tool that can handle even the toughest of projects. With the WEN 2-Speed Miter Saw, you can select your preferred speed with the simple flick of a switch for operation at either 2000 or 4500 rotations per minute. Switch on a metal-cutting blade to take on aluminum, steel and more. Bevel the head of the saw up to 45° to the left and miter up to 45° in either direction. Cut boards up to 12 in. wide and 3-1/2 in. thick or make compound cuts (45° bevel and 45° miter) 8-1/2 in. wide and 1-7/8 in. thick.

204668975,CM10GD,15 Amp Corded 10 in. Dual-Bevel Sliding Glide Miter Saw with 60-Tooth Carbide Saw Blade,"The innovation responsible for both the unique appearance and the unparalleled level of performance of the Bosch 10 in. Dual Bevel Glide Miter Saw is Bosch's patented Axial-Glide System. Beyond giving the saw its distinctive profile, Bosch's Axial-Glide System eliminates three key challenges miter saw users have endured since the first slide systems debuted many years ago. While the traditional sliding compound miter saw approach enables users to make wider cross cuts that system takes up more space and is prone to misalignment and stickiness over time. By replacing the sliding rail system with a hinged or articulating glide arm system similar to the linkage used in a four-bar suspension design Bosch created a more compact miter saw that delivers durable precision, remaining true and smooth over time.","MFG Brand Name : Bosch,Bullet06 : Includes: 10 in. 60-tooth blades, material clamp, dust bag,Bullet05 : Large easy-to-read uniform bevel and stainless-steel miter scales: 52° left/60° right miter capacity; 47° left/47° right bevel capacity with marked detents and roof pitch angles,Bullet09 : Bevel detents: 0°, 33.9°, 45° left/right for accurate cuts,Bullet08 : Push-button miter detent override easy-to-access thumb actuated control right up front for fine miter angle adjustment,Bullet23 : <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/c/electronics_recycling_programs style=color:#F96302; target=_blank>Click here for more information on Electronic Recycling Programs</a>,Bullet04 : Tall sliding 4-1/4 in. fences: for easy bevel setups and increased crown and base molding capacity,Bullet03 : Chop/crown lock: locks head in place for maximum chop cutting capacity for upright base molding and nested crown molding,Bullet07 : Adjustable miter detents: detents at 0°, 15°, 31.6°, 22.5°, 45°, 60° right super-accurate and durable design,Bullet10 : Category best 90% dust collection optimized for cutting 2X material with a vacuum,Bullet01 : Expanded cutting capacity: 12 in. horizontal capacity (nominal); 5-1/2 in. vertical capacity against the fence (base); 6 in. crown capacity against the fence (45° spring),Bullet11 : Ergonomic ambidextrous trigger handle with soft grip large form fitting ergonomic handle provides comfort for all-day use,Bullet02 : Upfront bevel controls all-metal bevel lock lever and range selector located upfront for quick and easy bevel settings without reaching behind the saw",544.99 / 544.99,"Product Highlight 2 : Upfront metal bevel controls and SquareLock precision fences,Product Highlight 3 : Includes 10 in. 60-tooth carbide-tipped blade, dust bag, wrench,Product Highlight 1 : Axial-Glide system allows wider cross cuts and better alignment",4.4659,"https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/be478759-be0f-4ecd-bda2-48f67ffe6da2/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-64_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/0dce660f-710a-4609-abfc-332959933291/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-e1_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/9d72aa44-d976-4499-b640-96ad6499ebd9/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-40_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/2adf1ec4-cfdf-4d52-8e57-ad761763982d/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-a0_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/547388ad-2dcf-4272-b459-918991c160b0/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-1d_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/84db9a04-448e-4dd8-99aa-5809d4eaaf78/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-66_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/4b055c44-18fa-4893-93c2-7e71a96a776e/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-77_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/834d3178-73d4-4a38-9bc3-c7527c8350a2/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-c3_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/7aa819f6-74d4-479e-b27f-f3d14386f08d/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-4f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/b427c83c-1a92-405f-b85e-6c4a2e5f5ae0/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-76_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/7e94925e-c75d-456e-8e30-601d45f92255/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-d4_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/2cc82590-6dea-405b-a1c5-c2610a6f3ac2/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-31_1000.jpg","Arbor Size : 0.625,Dust Collection Method : Bag,Miter Saw Type : Sliding Compound,90 Degree Crosscut Capacity Maximum - Right : 4 x 12,Returnable : 90-Day,Maximum Speed (rpm) : 4800,Color Family : Blue,Blade Diameter (in.) : 10,Amperage (amps) : 15,Cordless/ Corded : Corded,Condition : New,Cord Length (ft.) : 6,Construction Material : Aluminum,Portability : Bench,90 Degree Crosscut Capacity Maximum - Left : 4 x 12,Bevel Type : Dual,Product Weight (lb.) : 64,Maximum Degree Miter Cuts - Left : 52,Maximum Degree Miter Cuts - Right : 60,Maximum Cutting Thickness (in.) : 6,45 Degree Crosscut Capacity Maximum : 3.25 x 12.5,Tools Product Type : Power Tool,Power Tool Features : Electric Brake,Positive Stops,Bench & Stationary Tool Type : Slide Miter Saw,Included Accessories : Allen Key/Wrench,Table Width (in.) : 27,Product Width (in.) : 26.5,Table Length (in.) : 13.75,Product Depth (in.) : 32,Product Height (in.) : 20.5,Certifications and Listings : 1-UL Listed,Manufacturer Warranty : Limited 1 Year","Warranty : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/5b/5bc363fb-49a2-4e84-ac50-0f953200694c.pdf,Use and Care Manual : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/14/144329c9-e808-4138-8030-937890fb6dcc.pdf"

304166235,70730,2-Speed Single Bevel 10 in. Sliding Compound Miter Saw with Smart Power Technology,"Remember when you could cut through a board full of nails. We aren’t kidding. You can literally slice through a wooden board full of metal nails with the WEN 2-Speed Single Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw. This saw’s smart power technology implements an internal speed detection system to maintain consistent RPMs through materials of varying hardness. That means the saw’s torque automatically adjusts, increasing when sawing through knots and nails and decreasing for softer portions of the work piece. Combine that with our 15-Amp motor for a versatile tool that can handle even the toughest of projects. With the WEN 2-Speed Miter Saw, you can select your preferred speed with the simple flick of a switch for operation at either 2000 or 4500 rotations per minute. Switch on a metal-cutting blade to take on aluminum, steel and more. Bevel the head of the saw up to 45° to the left and miter up to 45° in either direction. Cut boards up to 12 in. wide and 3-1/2 in. thick or make compound cuts (45° bevel and 45° miter) 8-1/2 in. wide and 1-7/8 in. thick.

307417351,CM10GD+T4B,15 Amp Corded 10 in. Dual-Bevel Sliding Glide Miter Saw with 60-Tooth Saw Blade and Bonus Gravity Rise Stand with Wheels,"The innovation responsible for both the unique appearance and the unparalleled level of performance of the Bosch CM10GD 10 in. Dual Bevel Glide Miter Saw is Bosch's patented Axial-Glide System. Beyond giving the saw its distinctive profile, Bosch's Axial-Glide System eliminates three key challenges miter saw users have endured since the first slide systems debuted many years ago. While the traditional sliding compound miter saw approach enables users to make wider cross cuts that system takes up more space and is prone to misalignment and stickiness over time. By replacing the sliding rail system with a hinged or articulating glide arm system similar to the linkage used in a four-bar suspension design Bosch created a more compact miter saw that delivers durable precision, remaining true and smooth over time. Includes bonus T4B Folding-Leg Miter Saw Stand. The Bosch T4B gravity-rise miter saw stand features the patented gravity rise system and rapid set up and breakdown. It has an 18 in. material capacity which is the highest capacity among fully portable units. It has 8 in. pneumatic wheels which facilitate ease of transport over jobsite terrain. The stand also features rapid release tool mounts, adjustable leveling feet for stability on uneven surfaces and it also fits most competitors' miter saws. Bosch bench top tools provide the precision and performance your projects require. Durable quality is not only in every tool, but the trust you have in Bosch bench top tools.","MFG Brand Name : Bosch,Bullet08 : CM10GD: push-button miter detent override easy-to-access thumb actuated control right up front for fine miter angle adjustment,Bullet07 : CM10GD: adjustable miter detents: detents at 0, 15, 31.6, 22.5, 45, 60 right super-accurate and durable design,Bullet10 : CM10GD: category best 90% dust collection optimized for cutting 2x material with a vacuum,Bullet15 : T4B: adjustable height out feed of up to 12 in.,Bullet04 : CM10GD: tall sliding 4-1/4 in. fences: for easy bevel setups and increased crown and base molding capacity,Bullet16 : T4B: Includes gravity rise miter saw stand with wheels and universal rapid-release tool mounts,Bullet09 : CM10GD: bevel detents: 0, 33.9, 45 left/right for accurate cuts,Bullet13 : T4B: expansion rails expands material support up to 16 ft.,Bullet23 : <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/c/electronics_recycling_programs style=color:#F96302; target=_blank>Click here for more information on Electronic Recycling Programs</a>,Bullet14 : T4B: integrated rubber wheels easily move stand with saw attached from jobsite to jobsite,Bullet02 : CM10GD: upfront bevel controls all-metal bevel lock lever and range selector located upfront for quick and easy bevel settings without reaching behind the saw,Bullet11 : CM10GD: ergonomic ambidextrous trigger handle with soft grip large form fitting ergonomic handle provides comfort for all-day use,Bullet05 : CM10GD: large easy-to-read uniform bevel and stainless-steel miter scales: 52 left/60 right miter capacity; 47 left/47 right bevel capacity with marked detents and roof pitch angles,Bullet06 : CM10GD: includes: 10 in. 60-tooth blades, material clamp, dust bag,Bullet12 : T4B: universal rapid-release tool mounts fits most competitors' tools,Bullet01 : CM10GD: expanded cutting capacity: 12 in. horizontal capacity (nominal); 5-1/2 in. vertical capacity against the fence (base); 6 in. crown capacity against the fence (45 spring),Bullet03 : CM10GD: chop/crown lock: locks head in place for maximum chop cutting capacity for upright base molding and nested crown molding",948.0 / 948.0,"Product Highlight 2 : Upfront metal bevel controls and SquareLock precision fences,Product Highlight 3 : Includes bonus T4B folding-leg miter saw stand,Product Highlight 1 : Axial-Glide system allows wider cross cuts and better alignment",4.732,"https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/eee0c121-a76f-4205-97a8-b98850a9242d/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-64_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/4e8f4418-6f16-4584-af48-1a36f05a4a47/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-c3_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/b8825b76-947d-4135-abf4-62008aa877a9/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-4f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/deef1557-d8e8-4521-a6c3-0dd4bc33d2b9/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-1f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/df7eb3ee-4ae3-4be9-bb96-6e6dc27d49bd/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-44_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/c1e6b987-999f-47cf-b7d8-9d44f9418cdd/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-fa_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/6d80d420-8f1e-4c58-9d24-449731ab80b2/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t4b-76_1000.jpg","Arbor Size : 0.625,Miter Saw Type : Sliding Compound,Cuts Through : Wood,Returnable : 90-Day,Bevel Type : Dual,Color Family : Blue,Maximum Degree Miter Cuts - Left : 52,Power Tool Features : Electric Brake,Keyed Blade Change,Positive Stops,Maximum Degree Miter Cuts - Right : 60,Blade Diameter (in.) : 10,Corded Tool Type : Miter Saw,Power Source : Electric,Maximum Cutting Thickness (in.) : 6,Cordless/ Corded : Corded,Tools Product Type : Power Tool,Product Weight (lb.) : 64 lb,Condition : New,Cord Length (ft.) : 6,Dust collection type : Bag,Construction Material : Aluminum,Amperage (amps) : 15 A,Included Accessories : Allen Key/Wrench,Product Width (in.) : 26.5 in,Product Height (in.) : 20.5 in,Product Depth (in.) : 32 in,Certifications and Listings : 1-UL Listed,Manufacturer Warranty : Limited 1 Year","Use and Care Manual : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/0d/0d7b0cf7-137b-4ab9-a670-2fcfaa69bcb6.pdf,Warranty : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/cc/cce4938a-9602-4858-82df-b6777f00ff5e.pdf"

Folding Leg Stand,"The innovation responsible for both the unique appearance and the unparalleled level of performance of the Bosch CM10GD 10 in. Dual Bevel Glide Miter Saw is Bosch's patented Axial-Glide System. Beyond giving the saw its distinctive profile, Bosch's Axial-Glide System eliminates three key challenges miter saw users have endured since the first slide systems debuted many years ago. While the traditional sliding compound miter saw approach enables users to make wider cross cuts that system takes up more space and is prone to misalignment and stickiness over time. By replacing the sliding rail system with a hinged or articulating glide arm system similar to the linkage used in a four-bar suspension design Bosch created a more compact miter saw that delivers durable precision, remaining true and smooth over time. Includes bonus GTA3800 Portable Folding Leg Miter Saw Stand.

307397357,CM10GD+T1B,15 Amp Corded 10 in Dual-Bevel Sliding Glide Miter Saw with 60-Tooth Carbide Saw Blade and Bonus Folding-Leg Stand,"The innovation responsible for both the unique appearance and the unparalleled level of performance of the Bosch CM10GD 10 in. Dual Bevel Glide Miter Saw is Bosch's patented Axial-Glide System. Beyond giving the saw its distinctive profile, Bosch's Axial-Glide System eliminates three key challenges miter saw users have endured since the first slide systems debuted many years ago. While the traditional sliding compound miter saw approach enables users to make wider cross cuts that system takes up more space and is prone to misalignment and stickiness over time. By replacing the sliding rail system with a hinged or articulating glide arm system similar to the linkage used in a four-bar suspension design Bosch created a more compact miter saw that delivers durable precision, remaining true and smooth over time. Includes bonus T1B Folding-Leg Miter Saw Stand. The Bosch T1B Folding-Leg Miter Saw Stand features Universal Quick-Action Tool Mounts, to fit most miter saws on the market. This includes fitting Bosch 12 In., 10 in. and 8-1/2 in. single- and dual-bevel miter saws, as well as many competitor miter saws. Once attached to the saw mounts, users can attach and remove the miter saw from the stand without tools. The stand has smooth material supports that are adjustable in height to match the height of the user's miter saw. It also features integrated repetitive stops. The dual sliding rails extend out to a total of 8-1/2 ft. to support material up to 16-1/2 ft. wide.","MFG Brand Name : Bosch,Bullet08 : CM10GD: push-button miter detent override easy-to-access thumb actuated control right up front for fine miter angle adjustment,Bullet14 : T1B: adjustable leveling foot for work on uneven surfaces,Bullet10 : CM10GD: category best 90% dust collection optimized for cutting 2X material with a vacuum,Bullet13 : T1B: heights adjust to accommodate various sized saws,Bullet07 : CM10GD: adjustable miter detents: detents at 0, 15, 31.6, 22.5, 45, 60 right super-accurate and durable design,Bullet04 : CM10GD: tall sliding 4-1/4 in. fences: for easy bevel setups and increased crown and base molding capacity,Bullet12 : T1B: quick-action universal tool mounts fit most Bosch and many competitor miter saws; saws are removable without tools; rubber feet help protect tables or benchtops,Bullet09 : CM10GD: bevel detents: 0, 33.9, 45 left/right for accurate cuts,Bullet15 : T1B: lightweight, durable folding legs all-steel construction for jobsite performance and compact transport or storage,Bullet23 : <a href=https://www.homedepot.com/c/electronics_recycling_programs style=color:#F96302; target=_blank>Click here for more information on Electronic Recycling Programs</a>,Bullet02 : CM10GD: upfront bevel controls all-metal bevel lock lever and range selector located upfront for quick and easy bevel settings without reaching behind the saw,Bullet11 : CM10GD: ergonomic ambidextrous trigger handle with soft grip large form fitting ergonomic handle provides comfort for all-day use,Bullet05 : CM10GD: large easy-to-read uniform bevel and stainless-steel miter scales: 52 left/60 right miter capacity; 47 left/47 right bevel capacity with marked detents and roof pitch angles,Bullet06 : CM10GD: includes: 10 in. 60-tooth blades, material clamp, dust bag,Bullet16 : T1B: extra wide supports accommodates larger material and workpieces,Bullet01 : CM10GD: expanded cutting capacity: 12 in. horizontal capacity (nominal); 5-1/2 in. vertical capacity against the fence (base); 6 in. crown capacity against the fence (45 spring),Bullet03 : CM10GD: chop/crown lock: locks head in place for maximum chop cutting capacity for upright base molding and nested crown molding,Bullet17 : T1B: repetitive stops for making repetitive cuts to length",748.0 / 748.0,"Product Highlight 2 : Upfront metal bevel controls and SquareLock precision fences,Product Highlight 1 : Axial-Glide system allows wider cross cuts and better alignment,Product Highlight 3 : Includes bonus T1B folding-leg miter saw stand",4.1579,"https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/266b4d13-8dbc-4cc5-b58e-b226ad601da3/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t1b-64_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/d01db068-d4cf-4a7f-af9c-c1ab203b6bc4/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t1b-c3_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/06ad00d0-2b8c-42c7-ae30-9073280255d9/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t1b-4f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/a06b7d4b-55f8-4ee9-ac7b-b72b716dcc9f/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t1b-1f_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/996e971e-4c18-4695-9714-e97588b8e7c5/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t1b-44_1000.jpg,https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/72de6184-a9d1-4828-804f-33a0f7a16ce8/svn/bosch-miter-saws-cm10gd-t1b-fa_1000.jpg","Arbor Size : 0.625,Maximum Degree Miter Cuts - Right : 52,Miter Saw Type : Sliding Compound,Cuts Through : Wood,Returnable : 90-Day,Bevel Type : Dual,Color Family : Blue,Dust collection type : Port,Power Tool Features : Electric Brake,Keyed Blade Change,Positive Stops,Blade Diameter (in.) : 10,Corded Tool Type : Miter Saw,Power Source : Electric,Maximum Cutting Thickness (in.) : 6,Cordless/ Corded : Corded,Maximum Degree Miter Cuts - Left : 47,Tools Product Type : Power Tool,Product Weight (lb.) : 64 lb,Condition : New,Included Accessories : Allen Key/Wrench,Bag,Clamp,Cord Length (ft.) : 6,Construction Material : Aluminum,Amperage (amps) : 15 A,Product Width (in.) : 26.5 in,Product Height (in.) : 20.5 in,Product Depth (in.) : 32 in,Manufacturer Warranty : Limited 1 Year,Certifications and Listings : 1-UL Listed,cULus Listed","Warranty : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/43/43554339-1576-4e76-9b7f-2c6c42c2b708.pdf,Use and Care Manual : https://images.homedepot-static.com/catalog/pdfImages/29/29df68b2-b546-4ca0-8fa4-830824c9b9ac.pdf"
